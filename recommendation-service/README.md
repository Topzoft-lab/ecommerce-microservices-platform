# Recommendation Service

---

## **Overview**

The **Recommendation Service** is responsible for providing personalized product recommendations based on user behavior, purchase history, and product trends. It integrates with the **Product Service** and can also communicate with external APIs to improve recommendation accuracy. This service is built using Java (Spring Boot) for handling complex recommendation logic and Redis for caching frequently recommended products.

---

## **Dependencies**

- **Java**: JDK 11+
- **Spring Boot**: 2.6.2
- **Redis**: For caching recommendation results
- **RabbitMQ**: (Optional) For event-driven communication with other services
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing user preference data

## **API Endpoints**

### **1. Get Product Recommendations**

- **GET /recommendations/{user_id}**  
  **Description**: Retrieves personalized product recommendations for a specific user based on their behavior, purchase history, and preferences.  
  **Response**: Returns a list of recommended products tailored to the user.  
  **Best Practices**:
  - Uses Redis to cache recommendation results to improve response time and reduce computation.
  - Aggregates data from the **Product Service** and **User Service** for better recommendations.
  - Implements rate limiting to prevent abuse and overuse of recommendation resources.

### **2. Update User Preferences**

- **POST /preferences/{user_id}**  
  **Description**: Updates the userâ€™s preferences based on their interaction with products (e.g., likes, purchases). This helps improve future recommendations.  
  **Request**: Requires `user_id` and a list of preferences (e.g., liked categories, product types).  
  **Response**: Returns a success message once preferences are updated.  
  **Best Practices**:
  - Stores user preferences in PostgreSQL for long-term storage.
  - Uses machine learning or rules-based algorithms to adjust future recommendations based on updated preferences.
  - Validates input data to ensure correct preference formats.

## **Best Practices Implemented**

1. **Data Aggregation**:  
   - Aggregates data from multiple sources (e.g., **Product Service**, **User Service**, purchase history) to generate personalized recommendations.
   
2. **Machine Learning Integration** (Optional):  
   - The service can be integrated with machine learning models to improve recommendation accuracy based on patterns in user behavior and product trends.

3. **Caching with Redis**:  
   - Frequently recommended products are cached in Redis to reduce computation time and improve response times.
   
4. **Input Validation & Sanitization**:  
   - All inputs, such as user IDs and preference data, are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
   
5. **Event-Driven Architecture**:  
   - RabbitMQ can be used to trigger recommendation updates based on real-time user activity (e.g., product views, likes).

## **How to Run the Service**

### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed:
- JDK 11+
- PostgreSQL (local or hosted)
- Redis (local or hosted)
- RabbitMQ (optional)

### **Configuration**

Update the configuration in `src/main/resources/application.properties` to match your database and Redis setup:

```properties
# PostgreSQL Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/recommendation_service
spring.datasource.username=your_postgres_user
spring.datasource.password=your_postgres_password

# Redis Configuration
spring.redis.host=localhost
spring.redis.port=6379
